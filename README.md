# Django ORM, Django admin dashboard, & Restful API

## Django ORM

The 'models.py' file contains the necessary models needed for an E-Commerce Website such as a Customer class, Product class, Order class, and OrderItem class. After migrations, we can query records from the relational database, and we can create, update, and delete records. The model include one-to-one relationships, many-to-one relationships, and one-to-many relationships.

## Django admin dashboard

The Django admin dashboard serves as the command center of our e-commerce platform, providing administrators with an intuitive interface to manage various aspects of the system effortlessly. We can manage users, products, orders, and more through the admin dashboard.

## Restful API

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) enables different software systems to communicate over HTTP, similar to how browsers interact with websites. By incorporating the Django REST Framework, we can create an API that allows external applications to interact with our e-commerce platform programmatically. Essentially, third-party applications would be able to work with the data in our e-commerce applications.
